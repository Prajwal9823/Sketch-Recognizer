# 🖌️ Sketch Recognizer

A deep learning-based Sketch Recognizer built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and trained on Google's QuickDraw dataset. This app lets you draw a sketch on a canvas and predicts the object using a trained model. Includes a dropdown filter to limit prediction scope to specific classes.
